      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Bike tires have a certain life expectancy, just like a pair of running shoes do. When that time comes, you would have to
        make decisions in getting yourself new tires. While ensuring that they fit well on the bike is important, you may also
        consider variations to improve speed, durability or all-round performance.

      <h3>Getting a right tire size</h3>
      <p>
        To check for your bike tire's size, make reference to the tire's sidewall. The numbers are arranged in rough order
        of outer diameter and width, although it may not always be in that order. (Note: "c" does not stand for cm, but mm.)
      </p>

      <p>Here are some tire sizes for different types of bikes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Mountain bike: 29 X 2.3</li>
        <li>Road bike: 700 X 25c</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Tire widths</h3>
      <p>
        Tires with slightly varying widths can be installed on your bike. Things like rim size, fork size and frame tolerances
        may also need to be considered, so visit a bike shop for inquiry before trying this. Here are some example sizes for
        different road bikes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mountain bike tires: Outer tire dimensions can be between 1.9 inches to nearly 5 inches</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Cross country bikes: 1.9-2.3 inches wide</li>
          <li>Trail and all-mountain bikes: 2.3-2.5 inches wide</li>
          <li>Downhill bikes: up to 2.5 inches wide</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Road bike tires: between 23 and 45mm</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Getting the right treads for your bike</h3>
      <p>
        Tread patterns differ greatly between various riding styles. For mountain bikes, the tread consists of a wide variety
        of knot patterns. Road bikes, on the other hand, consist of tread pattern that ranges from slicks to more subtle groove
        patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knobby mountain bike types:
        <ul>
          <li>Small, closely spaced knobs: improve handling in both muddy and loose dirt conditions</li>
          <li>Siping: helps with grip in technical terrain like roots and rocks </li>
          <li>Widely spaced knobs: improve handling in both muddy and loose dirt conditions</li>
          <li>Small, evenly spaced knobs: help with cornering on hardpack</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Road bike tire types:
        <ul>
          <li>Slick bike tires: promotes unhindered rolling speed on smooth surfaces like asphalt</li>
          <li>Semi-slick bike tires: made for mostly smooth surfaces and some off-road riding, with a smooth centre and
          aggresive side treads to aid in cornering</li>
          <li>Inverted tread tires: Offer compromise between rolling speed on smooth surfaces and grip on
          not-so-smooth ones</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most tire track patterns are directional, so it is important to ensure that you are installing it in the
        correct orientation to avoid compromising on performance. At the same time, ensure that the replacement
        tire is a match, based on whether the tire is front-wheel or rear-wheel specific.
      </p>

      <h3>Misc</h3>
      <p>
        Bike tube sizing is similar to bike tire sizing with one exception. Since tubes can stretch, they will list
        a range of widths, and you need to be sure of the correct width range that the tube has with your tires. It is also
        important to take note what valve your bike tube uses. Bike tubes can use either Presta or Schrader valves, which
        are of differing diameters. Presta valves are thinner, so they require adapters to fit into Schrader rims. Schrader rims,
        on the other hand, are too large to fit into Presta rims.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some examples of alternative forms of bike tires are tubeless tires. While they require a conversion process, they allow for
        a lower tire pressure, which provides for better traction and a smoother ride. Such tires also eliminate the possibility of
        a flat tire due to pinching of the tube.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also consider getting puncture-resistant tires, foldable tires, or advanced rubber compound in bike tires. The first 2
        options will cost a heftier price than normal tires, however.
      </p>
