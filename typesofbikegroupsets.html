      <h3>Groupsets at a glance</h3>
      <p>
        A bike's groupset consists of shifters, ca chainset, a cassette, deraileurs, brakes, a bottom bracket,
        a chain, and cables. There are 3 leading groupset manufacturers, namely Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo.
        Groupsets are often arranged into heirarchies, with compatible parts grouped in order of quality and
        price.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Groupset heirarchies explained</h3>
      <p>
        The level of constant research and devlopment of groupsets often come at a cost, and elite components
        consisting of superior quality can often be expensive. However, lowe groupsets also continue to be
        updated with many breakthroughs of the higher tier products.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Differentiating between different brands</h3>
      <p>
        Campagnolo creates components that are knwon for their satisfying mechanical "clunks", sensational
        precision, and artistic apporoach to their product finish, design and activation. It also solely focuses
        on road bike components, which some feel adds to the quality of their mechanisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shimano, on the other hand, is one of the industry's biggest players. This means that it is almost
        standard issue in some quarters, and that its components tend to be compatible with a wide range of
        systems and bikes. Its shifting is slicker than its 2 rivals, while the brand is typified by quality
        and performance across its different heirarchies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, for SRAM, its selling point is its dedication to constant innovation. Their groupsets are
        also highly sought after for their industry-leading weight-saving properties for both road and MTBs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Types of groupsets</h3>
      <h4>MTB groupsets</h4>
      <p>
        The MTB bike groupset market is dominated primarily by Shimano and SRAM, with Shimano boasting about
        8 complete sets, and SRAM 9. MTB groupsets are generally designed to be tougher and more rugged to
        handle the rigours of the trail, which is a trade-off from the finesse that road components offer.
        1X systems have gathered huge popularity over the years, while triple chainsets have instead experienced
        a plunge in usage.
      </p>

      <h4>Road groupsets</h4>
      <p>
        Road groupsets are designed for one purpose in mind - speed. Such groupsets are built upon lean, clean and
        obscenely fast shifting machines. Gear ratios are also tighter, with speed and graduated climbing being the
        focus. 2X chainsets dominate the market, although 1X chainsets are embraced by a few who appreciate their
        weight-saving properties. All 3 manufacturers have also successfully introduced electronic shifting for their
        higher-end groupsets.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Upgrading components one at a time may require specialist knowledge, since most components are designed to work
        best within their brands and heirarchies. As such, it is best to stay in the brand. At the same time,
        ensure that the parts are of the same gear configuration. To decide on a groupset, establish a budget, and also
        ensure that the bike groupset fits your bike type.
