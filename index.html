      <h3>Basic bicycle maintenance tips for beginners</h2>

      <p>
        Bicycles, like many of the tools we use in our day-to-day lives, require
        some care to maintain. If you're looking to buy an expensive bike,
        maintenance then becomes of significant importance. Here are some tips
        to maximise your bike's shelf, life, and ensure that it does not rust or
        break down prematurely.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Consistently clean and lubricate the drivetrain.</h3>

      <p>
        Does your bike make squeaky sounds when you are riding it? That's probably
        a sign that the lubrication has worn off from the bike. It causes the
        metallic chains to rub against dirt, along with the other metal components
        of the drivetrain. Such chains are rather expensive, so you would be saving
        yourself a lot of trouble by regularly cleaning and lubricating the
        drivetrain. Here are some tools that you will need for this activity:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Disposable rags</li>
        <li>Bike oil</li>
        <li>Degreaser product</li>
        <li>A toothbrush or something else to pry off residue</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After cleaning the drivetrain with the rags and toothbrush, turn the crank
        slowly backwards and simultaneously apply a drop of bike oil on the inside
        of every link on your chain. You could also clean the frame and wheels
        while you're at it.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Keep your tires inflated.</h3>

      <p>
        The tire pressure plays a tremendous role in ensuring the quality of your
        bike ride. If the pressure is too low, it would take a lot more effort to
        keep the same speed, as compared to with a proper high pressure. You will
        also be more likely to hit flats, especially when hitting a curb hard. An
        extremely important tool you should have is a quality floor pump with a
        pressure gauge. You could check the suggested pressure on the side of your
        tires. The rear tire should have more pressure than the front, since it is
        taking more of the rider's weight. Ensure than you do check your tire
        pressure once a fortnight.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are not going to ride your bicycle for a long time, such as a couple
        of months, try to remember to keep the tires inflated even during the pause.
        If this is not possible, you should take the tires off completely. This
        ensures that cracks on the sides of the tires are prevented.

      <h3>3. Keep the nuts and bolts tight, but do not overtighten them.</h3>
      <p>
        Keep the screws, bolts and nuts in your bike where they belong by regularly
        checking if they are loose. Note that some newer bike models have a torque
        limit written on them, and that you can buy tools that only apply a specific
        amount of torque.

      <h3>4. Ensure that the brakes are adjusted correctly, and change the
      brake pads if necessary.</h3>
      <p>
        For some of you fast cyclists out there, it is pivotal to ensure that
        you stop effectively when needed to avoid nasty accidents from happening.
        If your bike fails to slow down quickly even after you have pulled the brake
        handle to touch the handlebar, you may have to adjust the brakes closer to
        the rim or the disc.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could tighten the adjusting barrel, if your brakes have one, in the
        brake lever or brake arm end. You may also need to unscrew the bolt holding
        the wire, tighten the wire, before screwing the bolt back on. Before
        tightening the bolt again, twist the adjuster holding the wire and the wire
        housing to the loosest setting. Also note that you should keep both the
        pads and the braking surface clean from dirt and oil, to reducing wear
        and tear of the brake components.
      </p>

        Reference the video below for a walkthrough on how to fix a flat tire on a
        bike:

      <p>
        If you are finding yourself constantly having to fix flat tires for your
        bike, you should check the tire and the inside of the rim for sharp objects
        or a protruding spoke.
